    question: "What is a DMCA Takedown?",
    answer: "A DMCA takedown is a process that allows copyright owners to request the removal of their copyrighted content from websites without their permission, as outlined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998. When unauthorized use is detected, the copyright owner can send a cease & desist takedown notice the host of the content. The host must then promptly remove or disable access to the infringing material to retain legal protections."

  {
    question: "How Can BrandSafe Improve My Brand?",

While we strive to provide the best service and continue to work diligently within the law to remove infringing content."
  },
  {
    question: "If I find infringing URLs, can I report them to you?",
    answer: "Yes, we have a \"Self-Submission\" tool where you can submit any URLs you find on your own, whether it a website or social media URLs. There is also no limit on how much you can self-submit!"
  },
  {
    question: "Can You Remove Content From Reddit?",
    answer: "Absolutely, BrandSafe scans Reddit to find infringing posts & also collects external links pirates are promoting! While Reddit is a great promotional tool, it also carries many subs that promote piracy."
